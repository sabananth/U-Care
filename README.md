# U-Care (The Univerty Care)
## An Intra-University Student Complaint Portal ( University of Vavuniya )
## Project Overview

We are going to develop complains management portal for students of University of Vavuniya.
This is a system which allows the students to express their problems within the University with or without showing their identity.
These complaints will be seen by a particular team which is assigned for this complaints/problems management.
Through this system the probability of finding the problems of the students will be increased. 
Here we like to provide complain facility for students in University level
